        "# Task 1 (4 points)\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the text for the task from the last workshop:\n",
        "\n",
        "- First, create a class `Person` that has two attributes: first_name, last_name. The class should also have one method that prints the information about the person called `print_name`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Second, create a class `Student` which will inherit the properties and methods from Person.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Next, create an object from the Student class and execute the `print_name` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Next, check the `__init__()` function in both classes. What can you conclude?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Can you recall what the `super()` function does?\n",
        "\n",
        "    *Read again:*\n",
        "    The `super()` function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent. By using the `super()` function, you do not have to use the name of the parent element, it will automatically inherit the methods and properties from its parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Next, add a property `graduation_year` to the `Student` class. Then alter the rest of the code so that this works properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Then, add a method called `welcome()` to the `Student` class that prints a welcome message including the name, surname and graduation year of the student.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Next, add a private instance attribute to the `Student` class, named `enrolment_status` (can be Not enrolled, Enrolment in progress or Enrolled). Try to use enumeration for this attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Then, create getters and setters where needed. Where should this be done?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Next, create a class `Teacher` with properties of your own choice, and make it inherit from `Person`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Then, change the `print_name` function for `Student` and `Teacher` to also state the role that they have. Create a list of `Person` objects and call this function on all of them. What happens?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Next, make the class `Person` abstract and add to it one method that you think makes sense in this manner. Why do you do this and what should you change now? Make the appropriate changes!\n",
        "\n",
        "- Think, did you use method overloading and/or overriding in this exercise?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Finally, create a class `School` that holds a list of students and teachers. What concept does this represent?\n",
        "\n",
        "_________________________________\n",
        "\n",
        "You can take the solution from the workshop (or your own, which is better) and you are now tasked to do the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Add a property `age` to the class `Student` and make it a private property. Add the appropriate getter and setter methods and make sure they work well.\n",
        "Write a comment about your implementation, explaining why you used the appropach you chose.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Add a property `education` to the class `Teacher` that will be of type enum and will detail the education of the teacher. It should take one of these values: MSc, PhD, Post-Doc.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. To the class `School` add two more properties that make sense to you and write a comment about your choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Alter the printing methods in all classes to include the newly added properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Create a class `Project` that has the following properties: `name`, `funding`, `mentor`, `students`, `start_year`, `end_year` (here, `funding` is a float number, `mentor` is a Teacher, `students` is a list of Student).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain in a brief comment the concept used to create the class `Project`.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. To the class `School` add a list of projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. In the class `School` add a functionality that should list all students that are born after some year specified as parameter. Apply all necessary changes to do so.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. In the class `School` add a functionality that should list all teachers that have an education specified as parameter. Apply all necessary changes to do so.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. Using the structure you have so far, add one more functionality of your own choice and explain why you believe it is useful in this code.\n",
        "\n",
        "And of course, don't forget to test your solution!"
